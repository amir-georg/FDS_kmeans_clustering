Description: 
	This package includes two main functions: kmeans_clustering(), which takes a numeric data frame and the desired number of clusters (k) as input and returns the results of the k-means 				
	clustering algorithm. The second function is the plot_clusters(), which takes the original data and the output of kmeans_clustering() to generate a scatter plot visualizing the clusters and 
	their centers.
